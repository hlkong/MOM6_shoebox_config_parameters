# MOM6_shoebox_config_parameters

### What this repository is for

This repository contains MOM6 configuration files (MOM_parameter_doc.all) for the "shoebox" GCM simulations used in the paper

> Hailu Kong and Malte F. Jansen, 2021: Time-dependent response of the overturning circulation and pycnocline depth to Southern Ocean wind stress changes

that has been submitted to Journal of Physical Oceanography.

### Naming convention

Each file provides specific MOM6 parameters for each GCM simulation used in the paper. Peak Southern Ocean wind stress is specified in the title, e.g., ```tp2``` denotes $\tau_0$ = 0.2 Pa.
